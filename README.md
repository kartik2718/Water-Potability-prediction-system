# Water-Potability-prediction-system
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict the quality of water on the basis of different factors from which potability of water is determined. The project consist of a frontend website which takes input features from the dataset as input and gives output as the machine learning model prediction for the water quality. The repository for the project containts html file for frontend website as index.html and flask code for integrating the machine learning model prediction into the frontend website as app.py. scaler.pkl and water_quality_model.pkl are the pickle files imported from ipynb file to the flask code and yield_df.csv is the dataset used for prediction. water_quality_monitoring_system is the ipynb file which contains the code for data analysis of the dataset and machine learning model for prediction of quality of water.
